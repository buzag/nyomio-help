      "answer": "Real-time GPS trackers allow users to monitor persons, animals, vehicles, or, really, anything else in real time. The user can track the subject's movement through frequent data updates that range from every few seconds to every few hours. GPS tracking uses a network of satellites to determine the location of a device. The difference between a GPS tracker and a normal, well-known car navigation system is that the navigation system provides you with your location and driving directions only, while a tracker either keeps a record of your driving habits or broadcasts its location in real-time."
