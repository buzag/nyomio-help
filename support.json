By tapping on Mode you can select the Mode you prefer: High accuracy: Delivers the most accurate location information by using GPS, Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to determine your location. It's got the highest accuracy, but it uses more battery and has less privacy. Battery saving: Saves battery by not using GPS, but still uses the other technologies. Less accurate and it has lower privacy. Device only: Best if you care a lot about privacy and are OK with somewhat less accurate data. Because it doesn't use cellular, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth, it leaves fewer digital tracks. IOS First tap on the Settings then on Privacy, and finally, please, tap on Location Services. Move the Location Services slider to on/green. Location Services are now turned on and Nyomio can start accessing your location right away.",

      "answer": "Real-time GPS trackers allow users to monitor persons, animals, vehicles, or, really, anything else in real time. The user can track the subject's movement through frequent data updates that range from every few seconds to every few hours. GPS tracking uses a network of satellites to determine the location of a device. The difference between a GPS tracker and a normal, well-known car navigation system is that the navigation system provides you with your location and driving directions only, while a tracker either keeps a record of your driving habits or broadcasts its location in real-time."
